                <h1>About Paul Chappell</h1>
<p>My name is Paul Chappell. I’m a retired programmer, living in the village of <a href="http://www.marsden.org.uk/">Marsden</a>, up in the Pennines, about 20 miles east of Manchester.</p>
<h2>My Main Passion, Programming</h2>
<p>Just because I’m retired, I haven’t stopped programming, I now code for myself (though, if you need help with a small project, I may be available for hire).</p>
<p>My main interest is in writing high-performance code using the C# programming language and release 6 of the .Net Framework (currently in preview; due to be released in November 2021). I’ve always felt that the performance of the original framework was poor. But with .Net Core and .Net 5/6 this has all changed, it’s now a lot faster, and it continues to get faster. I also like the fact that the new framework is no longer limited to Windows, you can target other operating systems, such as Linux (Ubuntu) and Android.</p>
<p>I’m also interested in writing websites, mainly their front-end performance, and data-driven sites, the one thing I’ll never be is a website designer. For performance, I now write my own CSS and Java Script, rather than use libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery.</p>
<p>As you can see from my <a href="/">home</a> page, I’m going to develop a dynamic website generator. I’ll be using this to explore high-performance code and building websites, in more detail.</p>
<h2>A Brief History</h2>
<h3>School and University</h3>
<p>At school I decided that I wanted to be a Civil Engineer, I wanted to build things. In 1973, I managed to get onto Sheffield Universities Civil Engineering course. As part of the course, we learnt to program in Fortran (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era">cards</a>!). It was much more interesting, so I switched to a career as a programmer. I still build things, just different things.</p>
<p>Had I been at school in the eighties, when home computers started to arrive, I might have studied computing at university. But in the early seventies, schools didn’t have computers, they didn’t even have electronic calculators. Until University I didn’t even know what a computer was. Most of the time we had to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_table#Tables_of_logarithms">mathematical tables</a> for calculations, though some departments had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_calculator#1900s_to_1970s">mechanical calculators</a>  (I think physics had a Triumphator).</p>
<p>Electronic calculators didn’t start to arrive until I was at University, in the second year. Until I eventually acquired one, I had to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule">slide rule</a>, mathematical tables were just too slow.</p>
<p>The world back then was very different to the one we live in now. The Dark Ages?</p>
<p>While at school, my mother said I should get into computers and programming. Hmm, take advice from mother, she was right of course.</p>
<h3>The Texas Instruments Years</h3>
<p>The best time of my career was the eighties. At the start of the decade, I started to code in assembler on Texas Instruments TI990 min-computers. This led me to an understanding of operating systems and how computers worked (especially TI). I began to understand how memory was used. And algorithms, such as the quick sort, binary chops and tree structures. I came across multi-threaded access to data and locking. I even wrote a few device drivers.</p>
<p>A lot of learning, which lead to a proper understanding of Texas Instruments computers, and computers in general.</p>
<p>These computers only had a 16-bit address, programs had to fit in 65K bytes or less. Another problem was that there was only 16-bit binary arithmetic. Soon after learning assembler, I had to code a set of functions to perform 32- bit arithmetic. This was the first really difficult code I wrote. They improved performance no end.</p>
<p>A big discovery I made during this period was that you can write programs that generate code. A technique I’ve used many times in my career to save on development time. It’s still a big interest of mine.</p>
<p>In the early eighties I went on a Telecoms course. I only have a few memories of it, but the main one is the lecturer’s opinion that we will probably be lucky to get more than 64Kb per second down a phone line, ever! But this was before digital exchanges, it shows just how far we’ve come in forty years.</p>
<p>This was my golden age.</p>
<h3>Tandem Non-Stop Computers</h3>
<p>Towards the end of the decade, into the early nineties, I started to work on Tandem Non-Stop computers. I was just beginning to gain a real understanding of how they worked, of how to program them, when the company I worked for went bust.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about Tandem Computers was that everything was duplicated (disks, CPU, etc). Applications that ran on the machine were designed to be fault tolerant and ran on two CPUs. If one failed, the applications running on it continued on the other CPU, while it was replaced. Data disks were mirrored. They even had batteries in case of power cuts. The idea was to have 100% uptime.</p>
<p>I wrote a fault tolerant transaction processor. At the time we were developing a banking system. It needed PCs out in branches, which could talk to and update the database on the main computer. It took requests from the various PCs, forwarded them to the code that processed the request, and then returned the response to the correct PC. This was in the days before the internet, and it’s still one of the most complicated programs I’ve written.</p>
<p>During this project I also met SQL and relational databases for the first time.</p>
<h3>Moving to Microsoft</h3>
<p>I then started to program with Visual basic and SQL Server. For a large part of the nineties, I worked for the card services department of a major UK bank.</p>
<p>It was during this period that I became an expert in Microsoft SQL Server. The early versions, those before SQL Server 2000.</p>
<p>For a long time, I was responsible for upgrading a few of the smaller computer systems at the bank. I don’t know how it works today, but back in the nineties you needed to plan upgrades in detail. You also needed a backup plan to restore the original system should a problem arise. Upgrades were performed over the weekend, and the system had to be working on Monday morning, failure was not an option.</p>
<p>Since then, I been programming on the Microsoft Platform. I’ve learnt a lot, Visual Basic, C#, SQL Server, .NET and Azure, but not in any real depth. I’ve also written a few websites.</p>
<h3>Recently</h3>
<p>In 2019 I wrote the <a href="https://www.ulverstonfallen.uk/home">Ulverston Fallen</a> website for my cousin. I decided to write it so I could get a good understanding of website development, especially front-end performance. During this period, I went from using library code for my CSS (bootstrap) and Java Script (jQuery) to writing my own, vanilla CSS and Java Script. This was done to make the website very fast. The one thing I did learn with this project, is that I’m not a website designer, and never will be.</p>
<p>During the winter of 2020/21 (and COVID lockdown), I spent a lot of time researching how to write high performance code using .Net and C#. I spent a lot of time reading the .Net source code to see how Microsoft does it (it’s very, very interesting). I’ve always found that reading other people’s code is useful. This <a href="https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/become-a-better-developer-by-reading-source-code">post</a> by Steve Gordon explains why.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I decided that I wanted to write a blog about high performance code, about what I was learning. It has now morphed into a blog about developing a dynamic website generator, see my <a href="/">home</a> page).</p>
<p>I’m going to have another golden age, this time it’s in my retirement. Rather than just sitting around watching TV, I’m going to design and write something for myself. I’ll also will make it open source, so that other people can use what I write. I hope you find it useful.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>I’ve been a programmer for more than forty years and the changes in computers have been massive. We are doing things now, that seemed impossible in the seventies and eighties. When I did the telecoms course, no one thought that within forty years or so we would be transferring giga-bytes down a phone line.</p>
<p>The first computer that I really understood, the TI, had a 16-bit address space and just 256K bytes of memory, I do not know how much it cost, but it was a lot. I’ve just had a look at the Azure Cloud pricing page, the largest machine I can find has 416 cores and 11,400G byte of memory. You can rent it for just over £83 an hour.</p>
<p>The TI had two hard disks; each was 50MB in size. Nowadays, even home computers have terabyte disks.</p>
<p>That’s the wonderful thing about this industry, it’s ever evolving.</p>
<h2>Other Interests</h2>
<p>I love music. My study is in the loft and most of the time some form of music will be playing. Sometimes music gets in the way of coding, sometimes coding gets in the way of music.</p>
<p>I love walking. I often walk in the countryside where I live, chewing over programming ideas and problems.</p>
<p>I love cooking curries, grinding and roasting my own spices. I also love real ale; I have been a member of <a href="https://camra.org.uk/">CAMRA</a> since the mid-seventies.</p>
<p>I love travelling, mainly in Europe, I’m not a great fan of long-haul flights.</p>
<p>I love taking photographs.</p>
