                    <h1>A Personal View of Blog Design</h1>
<p>Over the years I’ve read a lot of blogs. I leave a high proportion of them immediately; they are just too difficult to read, too much clutter.</p>
<p>I don’t mind people putting adverts on their blog, I do realise people want to make money from them. But I don’t like it when the adverts detract from reading; sometimes making it impossible to read the actual content. What’s the point of having bouncy balls up and down the side of a post? It just makes reading difficult.</p>
<p>Recently I came across a blog that had two asides to the right of the post, two of them! One third of the page width (on a large screen) for the post, one third for aside one and one third for aside two (I never looked at the mobile view, if there was one). The asides were full of information I didn’t need. I never read the post, though it looked interesting.</p>
<p>Asides are good when they present important information that does not distract from the main content. I’ve had conflicting thoughts about having an aside to my blog, there are good arguments for and against. They can point to other information on the blog, but they must be kept simple and unobtrusive. You can probably work out my current view on asides from whether or not this blog has one.</p>
<p>Often, people write a series of posts, rather than one long one, a good idea. Recently, I was searching for something or other, when I came across what looked like a very informative page. The trouble is, it was part three of a series and <em>there was no link back to the start, or to the next/previous post</em>. I had to google part one, then part two, and so on. It was a very interesting series of posts and was well worth reading. But it was a right royal pain getting to the individual parts. WHY?</p>
<p>People tag posts, and then have no means of listing all the posts for a given tag. If you can’t list all of the posts for a given tag, is there any point in having the tag?</p>
<p>Blog posts need a date <strong>at the top</strong> so I can determine how relevant the post is. If I do a google search on <em>Search Engine Optimisation</em>, I’m not interested in posts that are more than a few years old, because SEO changes so much. If there is no date, it makes it harder to see if the post is still relevant.</p>
<p>Another annoyance is sound. I’ve come across pages where something starts playing on the speakers the minute, I land on the page. This is incredibly annoying because I usually have music on in the background. I don’t want the Albion Band interrupted by someone talking about some product I will never buy.</p>
<p>I can go on, but I think you get the idea of my views on bad blog/website design.</p>
