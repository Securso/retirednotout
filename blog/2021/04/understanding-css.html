                    <h1>Understanding CSS</h1>
<p>I’ve had a lifetime of teaching myself to program, I almost gave up with CSS. I had all sorts of problems getting my web pages to look right, getting the correct spacing between lines, the correct margins, etc, etc. CSS seemed to be counter intuitive. I though brain surgery must be easier than this.</p>
<p>Then I bought a book, I highly recommend CSS In Depth by <a href="https://keithjgrant.com/">Keith J Grant</a>. Not the first book I bought on the subject, but one that sounded very good from its reviews. It turned out to be very good.</p>
<p>I now have a much better understanding of it. I learnt a lot about CSS by reading blogs and websites. What I missed trying to teach myself, was the basics, the quirks, how the CSS is built up, and what a Cascading Style Sheet actually is. Once you really start to understand the basics, it becomes easier to write.</p>
<p>Because I had so much trouble writing CSS, I used the Bootstrap library for my early sites. It sort of worked and it’s the approach I initially took with <a href="https://UlverstonFallen.Uk">Ulverston Fallen</a>. While writing the website, I came across this <a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=harry+roberts+css+bootsrap&amp;&amp;view=detail&amp;mid=3956C16B185512E9613D3956C16B185512E9613D&amp;&amp;FORM=VRDGAR&amp;ru=%2Fvideos%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dharry%2Broberts%2Bcss%2Bbootsrap%26qpvt%3Dharry%2Broberts%2Bcss%2Bbootsrap%26FORM%3DVDRE">talk by Harry Roberts</a>. After listening to it, I realised I had to ditch bootstrap, and start writing my own CSS. Ulverston Fallen was the first website where I tried to do this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I tried to do this before I bought the book, so the resulting CSS is not that good. But it seems to work, and more importantly the amount of CSS being sent down the wire is much lower, improving the speed of the website. Not only that, because it’s smaller, it compiles quicker, also reducing the rendering time.</p>
<p>The CSS for this website is a lot better (I think, I hope).</p>
<p>The other problem with CSS is knowing what features you can use. Some browsers out in the wild are more up to date than others. If you only use the latest browsers, then you can probably use the latest features. If you need to support IE11 then a lot of the latest features, like the grid, are not available. If you need to support IE6 (and why?) then the CSS has to be very basic. I find the website <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I Use</a>, very helpful for deciding what features to use.</p>
<p>This is all I will probably ever say about CSS in this blog, other people write about it in a much, much better way, and understand it much better than I ever will. I don’t write enough CSS to ever become an expert.</p>
