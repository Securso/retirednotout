                <h1>How to Contact Me</h1>
<p>This version of my website is fully static, so there is no contact form.</p>
<p>If you wish to contact me, please email me at secursopaul@outlook.com.</p>
<p>You should be aware that as emails are not necessarily secure, you should take care what you write. Also, there is no guarantee that your email will be transferred from you to me along secure links.</p>
<p>This email address is temporary, if I start getting a lot of spam on it, it will change. It is only used to contact me, initially. Once contact has been made, I will start using my usual email address.</p>
<p>Personally, I think email addresses must never, ever be published on a website, there are robots out there harvesting them for spammers. Ultimately, I’ll be writing code that will allow me to put a contact form on a static website. As soon as I’ve written it, this contact page will become a contact form. Until then, I need a temporary way for you to contact me. I quickly realised I must not publish any of my main email addresses on this page. However, there is no problem publishing a temporary one. If I get spammed too much, I’ll simply delete it and create a new one.</p>
