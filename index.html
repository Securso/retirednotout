                <h1>Developing a Website Generator</h1>
<p>Now that I’m retired, with time on my hands, I’ve decided to write a programming blog.</p>
<p>My main programming interest is writing high-performance code with .Net 5/6 and C#. I’ve been following .Net Core from its inception, and I’m impressed with its performance. I also like the way it can be used with multiple operating systems and that the source code is available. I’ll be exploring and using the preview versions of release 6 as they appear this year.</p>
<p>I’m also interested in developing websites, especially the front-end performance, and data-driven sites. Just the programming side, the one thing I’m not, is a website designer.</p>
<p>The initial idea was (and still is) to write about these subjects. The trouble is, I’m now retired and no longer writing commercial code, code that actually gets used. For that reason, I need a project, I need to actually write something.</p>
<p>For reasons covered in the <a href="/blog/2021/04/deciding-to-write-my-own-website-generator">first post</a> of my blog, I’ve decided to write a website generator.</p>
<p>To be different from the many static website generators out there, I also want it to be able to build data-driven and dynamic sites. For now, let’s call it a dynamic website generator. In order to process the dynamic content, there will also be an associated web server. I don’t know what functionality the generator is going to have yet (but I’ve lots of ideas). I’ll be spending the next few years of my retirement figuring this out and having a lot of fun.</p>
<p>I’ll be writing about its development in this blog.</p>
<p>My website generator will be available on GitHub, it will be an open-source project.</p>
<p>Because I’m no longer working for someone, I can and <em>will</em> follow my own path, and my own ideas. Not in total isolation, I would be interested in what other people think about what I’m doing, my contact page is <a href="/contact">here</a>.</p>
<p>This blog will become a testing ground for my ideas. Over time, I’ll be adding functionality to my website generator, and then using that functionality to improve my blog. The <a href="https://www.ulverstonfallen.uk/home">Ulverston Fallen</a> website, a site I wrote for my cousin, will also be a testing ground.</p>
<p>The generator will be a niche product. I don’t want to write something that is everything to everyone.</p>
<p>It’ll be written in C#, using the .Net Framework release 6 of the .Net Framework (currently in preview; due to be released in November 2021). It will also be a vehicle for researching the development of high-performance code, I’ll be writing a lot about this.</p>
<p>It’ll also use a lot of the functionality of the Microsoft Azure Cloud, especially for hosting the web server part of the generator (more about this in this <a href="/blog/2021/04/hosting-a-website-inexpensively">post</a>. I’ve been using Azure for a number of years. If properly setup, it’s very, very secure. It can also be very inexpensive for small personal and business websites.</p>
<p>I’ve no idea how long it’ll take, but I’m pretty sure that life will get in the way (especially as I want to learn to sail this year).</p>
<p>I hope you find my blog and the software useful.</p>
