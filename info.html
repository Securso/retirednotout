                <h1>Website Information</h1>
<p>This page of the website contains useful information about the site, my privacy statement and my cookies statement.</p>
<h2>The Important Bit</h2>
<p>Except where I quote directly, all opinions expressed here are my own. They may or may not be correct; they are based on my understanding of the software and or other products that I am discussing. If you think I’m wrong, I’d be grateful if you would contact me via my <a href="/contact">contact page</a>.</p>
<p>I cannot guarantee my software (that is, any public software you can access from my GitHub repositories) has been fully tested, you use it at your own risk.</p>
<p>This work and all of my public code is licensed under an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>.</p>
<h2>Cookies and Local Data</h2>
<p>The public version of this website does not use cookies, so there is no cookie notice. If I use cookies in the future, they will be for specific functionality (such as a sign-on page) and will be documented on this page.</p>
<p>This website does not track you and I do not pass any personal information supplied by you to third parties without your permission, <em>unless I am required to do so by law</em>. This will <em>never</em> change while I control this site’s content.</p>
<p>I do not use local storage on your browser, if this changes, the changes will be documented on this page.</p>
<h2>Java Script</h2>
<p>This website is aimed at people who develop software. In this day and age, I’d be surprised if any of you do not know what Java Script is. I’m assuming you do. I’m also assuming that you know how to enable and disable it.</p>
<p>It uses Java Script to improve site functionality. If you have turned Java Script off, some of the functionality will not be available to you.</p>
<h2>GDPR and Privacy</h2>
<p>This is a personal website so GDPR does not apply. However, I will follow the GDPR rules, I’m just not going to write about them here (I have a life).</p>
<p>I repeat, this website does not track you and I do not pass any personal information supplied by you to third parties without your permission, <em>unless I am required to do so by law</em>. This will <em>never</em> change while I control the site’s content.</p>
<p>The only personal data you give me is the information you supply via my contact page and subsequent emails. This will be stored in a secure manner.</p>
